Flack Chat

Flack Chat is a chat system produced using Websockets via Flask-SocketIO library and JavaScript Socket.IO. The system enables users to login from the index page simply by choosing a username. A user is able to open, close or join rooms as they wish. They are also able to send private chat messages to any user they come across on the service by clicking on the users name on the list.
